    <p>"After I folded, Danny showed me his hand. I looked at him and said, 'Good play.' What else am I going to tell him?
	I don't know how many people believe that I f***ed up by changing my mind. But I f***ed up because every card that made a hand for him came out. 
	It shouldn't have been that hard. I could have called. But I didn't." -Daniel Negreanu
